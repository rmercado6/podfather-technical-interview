# Podfather Technical Test

## Brief

Included is a data file (pod_data.csv) containing the estimated and actual quantity of waste collected per month for 
several clients.

We would like you to develop a simple application to display the data in a format that can be easily read and understood
by a human.

Please include an element of user input such as a search or filtering.

The requirements are very loosely defined to allow you to design and develop an application which demonstrates the range
of your knowledge. You might choose to focus on frontend, backend or both. Choose a language and approach that best 
shows your skills.

It is not necessarily essential for you to have experience in all of the areas below, but please try to demonstrate your
range of skills where possible:

- Production of high quality, maintainable code which displays a strong knowledge of best practices.
- Use of git â€“ a sensible commit history
- Understanding of data types and their appropriate uses.
- Writing testable code
  - While we do not expect you to write tests in the given timeframe please be aware that testing approaches may be 
    discussed during the follow up interview.
